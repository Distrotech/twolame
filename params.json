The frontend takes very similar \r\ncommand line options to LAME, and the backend library has a very \r\nsimilar API to LAME.\r\n\r\nFor the latest version of TwoLAME, visit the project homepage:\r\nhttp://www.twolame.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nMPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2)\r\n------------------------\r\n(taken from Wikipedia article on MP2)\r\n\r\nMP2 (sometimes incorrectly named Musicam) is a short form of MPEG Audio Layer II, \r\nand it is also used as a file extension for files containing audio data of this \r\ntype. While it has largely been superseded by MP3 for PC and Internet applications, \r\nit remains a dominant standard for audio broadcasting as part of the DAB digital \r\nradio and DVB digital television standards. It is also used internally within the \r\nradio industry, for example in NPR's PRSS Content Depot programming distribution \r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\n\r\nStandard automake process:\r\n\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n  make install\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE PAPERS\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n(Specifically Layer II Papers)\r\n\r\nKumar, M & Zubair, M., A high performance software implementation of mpeg audio \r\nencoder, 1996, ICASSP Conf Proceedings (I think)\r\n\r\nFischer, K.A., Calculation of the psychoacoustic simultaneous masked threshold \r\nbased on MPEG/Audio Encoder Model One, ICSI Technical Report, 1997\r\nftp://ftp.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/real/kyrill/PsychoMpegOne.tar.Z \r\n\r\nHyen-O et al, New Implementation techniques of a real-time mpeg-2 audio encoding \r\nsystem. p2287, ICASSP 99.\r\n\r\nImai, T., et al, MPEG-1 Audio real-time encoding system, IEEE Trans on Consumer\r\nElectronics, v44, n3 1998. p888\r\n\r\nTeh, D., et al, Efficient bit allocation algorithm for ISO/MPEG audio encoder,\r\nElectronics Letters, v34, n8, p721\r\n\r\nMurphy, C & Anandakumar, K, Real-time MPEG-1 audio coding and decoding on a DSP\r\nChip, IEEE Trans on Consumer Electronics, v43, n1, 1997 p40\r\n\r\nHans, M & Bhaskaran, V., A compliant MPEG-1 layer II audio decoder with 16-B \r\narithmetic operations, IEEE Signal Proc Letters v4 n5 1997 p121\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
